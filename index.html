        <p>
            One of the central issues being protested at the Women’s March was reproductive rights. In 2016, 43% of American adults considered abortion to be morally acceptable, according to Gallup. Though this number is below half the population, it’s worth noting
            that only half the population is able to give birth in the first place. It therefore is not too surprising that most of the hundreds of thousands of people who attended the march were women. <br>

            <br>Over half of the American public now views gay and lesbian relations as morally sound, according to Gallup. This is a huge stride from the past few decades, however, the transgender community is now one of the most vulnerable groups in
            President Trump’s America. Transgender students no longer have federal protection to use the public bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity, however, CNN reported that in 2016, 75% of adults admitted to favoring laws that would
            guarantee equal protection for transgender people in jobs, housing and public accommodations.</p>

        <p>The shunning of immigrants, refugees, and undocumented families make up another major cause for protest in President Trump’s America. 40% of respondents to an online panel conducted by the Pew Research Center believe that a wall with Mexico is
            'not at all important. Siham Mamand, 43, identifies as Kurdish, though she carries an Iraqi passport so as to be able to travel internationally. Trump’s temporary travel ban prevented her from attending a conference at the United Nations in
            early February. “I’m not even Iraqi, I’m Kurdish. Americans rely on Kurdish help to fight their wars.” she said over email.<br>

            <br>Regardless of race, gender, class, or political affiliation, climate change is affecting all Americans, which is why so many scientists are taking to the streets to dissent. While President Trump may not prioritize or even acknowledge
            that it is occurring, the Pew Research Center found that 74% of American adults admit feeling "some level of concern" about climate change in 2016. 36% of adults feel "a great deal of concern" about climate change.</p><br>
